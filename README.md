# Design

Since I work on both the design and coding part of the project design files are only for guidance and might not look exactly the same on production. I like to tweak and change some parts of the design directly when coding.

You can find the design on figma:
- [Figma Project](https://www.figma.com/file/4FNOok2FZt2DetpgUZVkSG/Derum) 

Comment on this issue if you would like to contribute to the design:
